##  <i class="fas fa-user"></i> Interests

- **NLP (Natural Language Processing):**
  My research is rooted in the social sciences, with a focus on quantitative methods and innovative approaches like natural language processing and deep learning. In particular, I am interested in how to ensure the validity of text-based measures of social science constructs. 

- **Election Studies**
I have a background in political science, and my recent research centers around political elections. Specifically, I've been studying **postal voting** ("Briefwahl") and **voter turnout** (Wahlbeteiligung) within the German electoral system.


- **Sharing Knowledge and Skills:**
  I'm passionate about teaching **R**, a powerful programming language for statistical computing and graphics. Furthermore, I also teach courses on NLP and "Business Research Methods"

- **Personal Interests**
Beyond my academic pursuits, you'll often find me exploring the great outdoors, whether hiking or cycling in the Odenwald, Schwarzwald, or the Alps. Alternatively, you might spot me engrossed in a game of chess or enjoying a cup of coffee in a vibrant café setting.
