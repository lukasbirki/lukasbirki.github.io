As a PhD student in Digital Data Quality at [GESIS- Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences](https://www.gesis.org/home), I am dedicated to advancing my knowledge and understanding in the field of digital data quality. I have a strong academic background, holding an MSc in <i>Big Data and Digital Futures</i> from the University of Warwick and a MA in <i>Politics and Public Administration</i> from the University of Konstanz. My professional experiences, including internships and work at the Ministry of Economy, Labor, and Housing Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the University of Duisburg-Essen, and the University of Konstanz, which have provided me with a diverse set of skills and perspectives.

# My Research

## NLP 

My research is grounded in the social sciences, with a particular focus on empirical quantitative methods and innovative methodological approaches, such as natural language processing and deep learning. I am particularly interested in exploring a broad range of topics, including the quality of digital behavior data, data literacy, empirical-based decision-making, and the impact of digital technologies on society, politics, and public administration. I am excited to contribute to the field by providing valuable insights and perspectives through my research.

## Others

I have a passion for sharing my knowledge and skills with others, and one of the ways I do this is through teaching R. R is a powerful programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. 
I offer a variety of R training options, including workshops, seminars, and one-on-one consulting. In my workshops, I cover the basics of R and provide hands-on exercises to help students gain a solid understanding of the language. In my seminars, I delve into more advanced topics, such as machine learning and data visualization, and provide students with the opportunity to work on a project of their choice. Finally, in one-on-one consulting, I work with students to tailor the training to their specific needs and goals.

I am committed to helping others learn and grow, and I believe that teaching R is one of the best ways to do that. Whether you are a beginner looking to get started with R or an experienced user looking to take your skills to the next level, I am here to help.
