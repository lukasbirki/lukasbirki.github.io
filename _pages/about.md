Great to have your here!

Who am I?
======
I am a PhD Student in Digital Data Quality at [GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences](https://www.gesis.org/home). 

I hold an MSc in Big Data and Digital Futures from the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/) and a MA in Politics and Public Administration from the [University of Konstanz](https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/). Moreover, I have gained practical experiences at the ministry of economy, labor and housing Baden-Württemberg, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the university of Duisburg-Essen and the university of Konstanz.  

My research is based within the social sciences, with a strong emphasis on empirical quantitative methods and innovative methodological approaches, such as natural language processing and deep learning. 
My interest lies in a broad range of topics, such as the quality of digital behaviour data, data literacy, empirical based decision-making and the impact of digital technologies on society, politics and the public administration. 

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
