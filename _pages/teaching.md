I have been in the field of education for a while now, and I have had the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with students in various settings. During my studies, I was an academic Tutor for Prof. Dr. [Florian Kunze]("https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/kunze/") at the university of Constance. Moreover, I have extensive experience in given R-courses to students and professionals who wanted to expand their skills in data analysis and programming. These courses were designed to provide hands-on experience and real-world applications of the R programming language.

This year, I have taken on a new challenge and started to teach my first course in "Business Research Methods" at the [SRH Heidelberg]("https://www.srh-hochschule-heidelberg.de/") in a practical cooperation with a large-cap German company. This course is unique because it combines theoretical concepts with practical applications, providing students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge in a real-world setting. The cooperation with the company allows students to gain valuable insights and experience working with real data and projects.

I am excited to continue expanding my teaching experience in the coming years!
